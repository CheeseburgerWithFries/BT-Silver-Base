HOW DO I INSTALL THE LATEST WT SILVER:
	You have two options for installing silver:
		1. download a stable build from the following mega link https://mega.nz/#F!pFI1EKyA!KLf9DamlGnXGw6qQAyG7Ig
		
		2. for an experimantal version of the game you can download the latest build from here on git then copy replace the game folder into the "shell" game from the following google drive link https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bydic_JmulRMRDliYnF0VHVwVXM&usp=sharing

WHAT IS SILVER?:
	It's essentially a modpack of a few different mods and some new content. It adds some new scenes, a map, scene changes, potions, custom outfits and evolving outfits. At the moment it is in a  beta state with new content and bug fixes being added periodically.
	▪ Cheats are in the closet

SHOULD I DOWNLOAD THIS OR THE RUSSIAN VERSION?:
	That is completely a personal choice. The Russian version is almost certainly a more complete product than silver. At the present point in time I would recommend the Russian version over silver if you want a complete play through. If you want to do some bug testing or just see the new content and already have BT then download silver.
